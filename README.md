# Chest SDK

`@argentic/chest-sdk` is what a server tool (tool contract v2) embeds to talk
with its Chest: the member the Chest asserts on a request, the address of the
tool's own database and its private files. The SDK has no dependency: it only
imports `node:*`.

```sh
npm install @argentic/chest-sdk
```

Node 22 or later. ESM only, compiled JavaScript with its type declarations.

## Imports

Each module is its own subpath and pulls in nothing else; the root gives them
all, with the files API as the namespace `files`.

| Import | Gives |
|---|---|
| `@argentic/chest-sdk/member` | `member(request)`, type `Member`: the member of a request on the team host of a server tool, read from the `Chest-Member` assertion and verified; `null` without a valid assertion |
| `@argentic/chest-sdk/database` | `databaseUrl()`: the address of the tool's own PostgreSQL database (capability `database`) |
| `@argentic/chest-sdk/files` | `put`, `get`, `stat`, `list`, `move`, `delete`, `url`, `uploadUrl`, types `FileObject`, `FileData`, `FilePage`: the tool's private files (capability `files`), kept by the Chest, a 15-minute signed link to one (or to its thumbnail), and uploads straight from a member's browser |
| `@argentic/chest-sdk/errors` | `ChestError` (`code`, `status`), `CapabilityNotGranted` (403), `TooLarge` (413), `QuotaExceeded` (429), `Unavailable` (503): what the SDK throws when the Chest does not give what a tool asks |
| `@argentic/chest-sdk` | all of the above; `files` as a namespace |

```ts
import { member } from "@argentic/chest-sdk/member";
import { databaseUrl } from "@argentic/chest-sdk/database";
import * as files from "@argentic/chest-sdk/files";
import { CapabilityNotGranted } from "@argentic/chest-sdk/errors";
// or: import { member, databaseUrl, files } from "@argentic/chest-sdk";
```

Types refer to `node:http` (`IncomingMessage`): a TypeScript project needs
`@types/node`, as any Node project does. Both `moduleResolution` `bundler` and
`nodenext` work.

### Next.js

The SDK runs on the server only — it reads the tool's environment
(`CHEST_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `CHEST_API`) and uses Node built-ins. Import it
in route handlers, server components or server actions, never in a
`"use client"` module. Webpack and Turbopack resolve the
compiled package with no configuration (no `transpilePackages`):

```ts
// app/chest/api/me/route.ts
import { member } from "@argentic/chest-sdk/member";

export function GET(request: Request) {
  const who = member(request);
  return who ? Response.json(who) : new Response(null, { status: 401 });
}
```

## The contract, in short

A v2 tool is an ordinary web server in a container without network, run by
its Chest. The Chest's front is the only one to reach it; the tool reaches only
what its launcher gives it on `127.0.0.1` (its database, the Chest's API for
its files). Rights come from the Chest — the signed member, the capabilities
approved for the version — and the Chest enforces them even outside the SDK:
the SDK makes the calls easier, it is not a security boundary. The full
contract (manifest `chest.json`, capabilities, build from source, catalogue)
is described in the Chest repository, `docs/architecture.md`.

## `member(request)` — server tool (contract v2)

A v2 tool is an ordinary web server; on its team host, the Chest relays
`/chest` and everything below it with the `Chest-Member` header of the
signed-in member. `member(request)` accepts a Node request (`IncomingMessage`)
or a Web `Request` and returns:

```ts
type Member = { id: string; firstName: string; lastName: string; name: string; email: string; photo?: string; role?: string; isAdmin: boolean; isBuilder: boolean };
```

or `null`: without the header, on the public host (the Chest never sends an
assertion there and strips a client's), or for any assertion that is not
exactly its own. Checks: compact JWS, header exactly
`{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}`, HMAC-SHA256 signature compared in constant time
under the key HMAC-SHA256("Chest-Member v1") of the text of `CHEST_TOKEN` —
the Chest's derivation —, `aud` equal to `CHEST_TOOL`, `iat` and `exp` within
5 s, the shape of each claim (an unknown claim is ignored). Without
`CHEST_TOKEN` or `CHEST_TOOL`, nobody is a member. The function never throws
for what a request carries.

```ts
import { member } from "@argentic/chest-sdk/member";
const who = member(request);
if (!who) { response.writeHead(401).end(); return; }
```

`photo` is the address of the photo on the team host, `role` the role the
Chest gives the member among those the manifest declares. Only the Chest's
front reaches the container: the signature is a second defence; business rules
(who writes what) remain the tool's.

## `databaseUrl()` — database of a server tool

A v2 tool that declares `"capabilities": ["database"]` in its `chest.json`
gets a PostgreSQL database of its own (the capability is shown and approved
like a permission, in the approval screen). The container has no network: its
launcher listens on `127.0.0.1` and relays each connection to the Chest. The
launcher sets `DATABASE_URL` —
`postgres://<user>:<password>@127.0.0.1:<port>/<database>?sslmode=disable`,
the user and the database both named `t_<tool>` — and `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`,
`PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`, which take precedence over a variable of
the tool with the same name. `databaseUrl()` returns `DATABASE_URL` when it has
exactly this shape, and throws `CapabilityNotGranted` otherwise (a version
without the capability, or a `DATABASE_URL` of the tool's own). The value is a
secret: never log it, never send it to a browser.

The SDK carries no PostgreSQL client: the tool picks its own, for example
[`postgres`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) (porsager, no dependency) or
[`pg`](https://node-postgres.com):

```ts
import postgres from "postgres";
import { databaseUrl } from "@argentic/chest-sdk/database";
const sql = postgres(databaseUrl(), { max: 5 });
const notes = await sql`SELECT id, text FROM notes ORDER BY id`;
```

Ten connections at most per instance; a query longer than 30 s, a transaction
idle longer than 60 s are interrupted by the Chest. **Migrations**: the
repository's `migrations/NNNN_name.sql` files
(`^[0-9]{4}_[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}\.sql$`, 256 at most, 1 MiB each) are run by the
Chest, in order, each in its own transaction, at install and at every update,
before the new version receives traffic; a failing file keeps the version in
service. The Chest keeps the list of files run (table `chest_migrations`): a
version that loses one or changes one is refused. A migration must leave the
previous version working — going back to the previous version undoes nothing.

## `files` — files of a server tool

A v2 tool that declares `"capabilities": ["files"]` (approved like a permission)
keeps private files **through its Chest**, never on its disk (the container's
root is read-only). The launcher gives the tool
`CHEST_API=http://127.0.0.1:<port>` — its own port, relayed to the Chest; the
container has no network — and the instance is the identity: the tool reaches
its own files only.

```ts
import * as files from "@argentic/chest-sdk/files";
await files.put("photos/cat.png", bytes, "image/png");       // Uint8Array or text
const file = await files.get("photos/cat.png");              // {data, type, size} or null
const info = await files.stat("photos/cat.png");             // {name, type, size, updated, width?, height?} or null
const { files: page, next } = await files.list({ prefix: "photos/" }); // 1000 per page
await files.move("photos/cat.png", "archive/cat.png");       // atomic; replaces archive/cat.png
await files.delete("archive/cat.png");                       // true, or false if it did not exist
const { url, expiresIn } = await files.url("photos/dog.png", { thumbnail: 256 });
```

A name: up to 8 segments of 1 to 100 letters, digits, `.`, `_` or `-`,
separated by `/`, none starting with `.` or `-`; refused before anything is
sent otherwise (`ChestError`, `invalid_name`).

### Limits

Per tool: 1 GiB, 10,000 objects and 32 MiB per object, unless its manifest
asks otherwise — approved by the owner like any permission, and a later
version that asks more is approved again:

```jsonc
// chest.json
{ "capabilities": ["files"], "files": { "quota": "5 GiB", "maxObject": "100 MiB" } }
```

`quota` goes from 100 MiB to 100 GiB (10 GiB and more allow 100,000 objects),
`maxObject` from 1 to 512 MiB; the owner or an admin may also set the quota
by hand. The SDK refuses beyond 512 MiB before sending anything; the Chest
holds the tool to its own bounds (`TooLarge`, `QuotaExceeded`). `put` and
`get` carry the bytes through the tool's server: for large files, let the
browser upload them itself.

### Uploads from a member's browser

The bytes go from the browser to the Chest directly, never through the tool.
The tool authorises one upload, in a `/chest` route, once `member()` said who
asks:

```ts
// Server side: app/chest/api/invoices/upload/route.ts
const up = await files.uploadUrl("invoices/2026/0042.pdf", {
  maxSize: 10 << 20,                // bytes; the tool's largest object when not said
  types: ["application/pdf"],       // up to 8, "image/*" for a family; any when not said
  expiresIn: 300,                   // 1 to 900 seconds; 900 when not said
});
// → { url, method: "PUT", expiresIn }: hand it to the member's browser
```

```ts
// Browser side, on a page under /chest: the member's session goes with it
const response = await fetch(up.url, { method: "PUT", body: file, headers: { "Content-Type": file.type } });
// 201 {name, type, size}; 403 invalid_token (used, expired), 415 type_refused,
// 400 type_mismatch, 413 too_large, 429 quota_exceeded, 401 without a session
```

```ts
// Server side, when the browser says it is done
const info = await files.stat("invoices/2026/0042.pdf"); // null if nothing came
```

`url` is `https://<tool's team host>/_chest/files/upload/<token>`: the same
origin as the tool's `/chest` pages, so no CORS. The token is signed by the
Chest and binds the name, the size, the types and the expiry; it serves once.
A name ending in `/` is a folder: the Chest then names the object (20 hex
characters and an extension from its type) and answers its name. The Chest
checks the declared size before reading, drops the body at the first byte too
many, and for images, PDFs and archives checks that the first bytes are of the
type sent; nothing of a refused upload remains. There is no antivirus scan.
`uploadUrl` answers `Unavailable` while the Chest does not know the tool's
team host yet.

### Links and thumbnails

`url(name, {thumbnail?, download?})` signs a link to the file as it is, on the
tool's **team host** (`/_chest/files/…`): whoever has it opens it without
signing in for 15 minutes, or until the file changes or goes; the Chest serves
it in a sandbox, displayed for an image, a PDF or plain text, downloaded
otherwise, or always downloaded with `download: true`. `thumbnail: 256` or
`1024` links to the image reduced to that many pixels (JPEG, PNG, GIF — its
first frame — and WebP up to 40 megapixels; `ChestError` `no_thumbnail`
otherwise); thumbnails are made once, not counted in the quota. `stat` gives
`width` and `height` for these images. Give a link to a member's browser,
never to a public page.

Errors: `CapabilityNotGranted` (a version without the capability, or no
`CHEST_API`), `TooLarge` (413), `QuotaExceeded` (429), `Unavailable` (the
Chest not reached, or an answer that is not its own: a write may or may not
have happened), `ChestError` for the rest (`invalid_type`, `no_thumbnail`,
`not_found` for `url` and `move`…). Removing the tool removes its files; a new
version keeps them.

## Version

The package version is `version` in `package.json` (semver), published by a
tag `vX.Y.Z` (see `PUBLISHING.md`).

## The MCP server

The MCP server an assistant runs to work on a Chest, `@argentic/chest-mcp`,
lives in its own repository:
[chest-by-argentic/Chest-MCP](https://github.com/chest-by-argentic/Chest-MCP).

## What this repository is not

This repository is public and **is not a tool**: it has no `chest.json`, and a
Chest's catalogue — which only lists the organisation's public repositories
that carry a manifest — never offers it.

## Develop

```sh
npm ci
npm test               # build dist/, compile the tests into build/, run them
npm run check:package  # npm pack, install into a temp project, import every subpath
                       # from Node and through esbuild, type-check a TS consumer
```

`client/src` holds the modules, `client/index.ts` the package root,
`client/test` the tests. `npm run build` compiles `client/index.ts` and the
four published modules (`errors`, `member`, `database`, `files`; TypeScript
strict, ES2022, NodeNext) into `dist/`: ESM `.js`, `.d.ts` and their maps.
The package stays dependency-free (`node:*` only) and reaches nothing but the
Chest's API on `127.0.0.1`. `AGENTS.md` is a usage guide for AI agents
building a tool with this package.
